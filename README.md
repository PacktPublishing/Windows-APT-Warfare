**Identify and prevent Windows APT attacks effectively**

## What is this book about?
An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a severe form of cyberattack that lies low in the system for a prolonged time and locates and then exploits sensitive information. Preventing APTs requires a strong foundation of basic security techniques combined with effective security monitoring. This book will help you gain a red team perspective on exploiting system design and master techniques to prevent APT attacks. Once you’ve understood the internal design of operating systems, you’ll be ready to get hands-on with red team attacks and, further, learn how to create and compile C source code into an EXE program file. Throughout this book, you’ll explore the inner workings of how Windows systems run and how attackers abuse this knowledge to bypass antivirus products and protection.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore various DLL injection techniques for setting API hooks
* Understand how to run an arbitrary program file in memory
* Become familiar with malware obfuscation techniques to evade antivirus detection
* Discover how malware circumvents current security measures and tools
* Use Microsoft Authenticode to sign your code to avoid tampering
* Explore various strategies to bypass UAC design for privilege escalation
